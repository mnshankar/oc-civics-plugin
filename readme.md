US Citizenship/Naturalization Test Flash Cards. Because.. ignorance is not cool :-)

This OctoberCMS plugin provides an easy drop-in package to help you brush up on your (US) civic knowledge.

The civics flash cards can be accessed by placing the 'questionnaire' component on any page.

## Features
1. Option to randomize order of questions
2. Uses a self-contained table installed along with the package
3. Seed file for list of questions is provided. So, if/when answers to questions do change,
updating the system is as easy as updating the seed file and reseeding (refreshing the plugin)
4. Simple styling with Twitter Bootstrap
